Corporate events are not only the way to maintain good professional relations with your employer and your colleagues, but also a way to have a good time, right? Not at all! In reality, they are the main enemy of your career. Let me explain.

### You Are Just A Resource

Let's start with the harsh truth: you are not a person. Even not a human being. You are a money-making tool of your employer. Some employers even call you "a resource" and refer to you by your "resource ID", did you know about that?

### You Must Be Profitable

Being a tool for money-making, you must be profitable. If you are not profitable, you are fired. Nobody is going to coddle (?) with you.

What is the profitability? In a simple language, it is a difference between how much you earn for your employee and how much your employee spends on you.

Obviously, the bigger is your profitability the more chances you have to succeed as an employee. If it is close to zero or, god forbid, negative, you will be eventually fired.

### Killers Of Your Profitability

That's it. Everything is super-simple. All the other stuff, like corporate trainings you attend, brownbag presentations you give and new joiners you coach, __does not matter at all__! Nobody cares, really. (Well, except for your employer, twice a year: these things are a valid reason to not give you your promotion, but that's a bit different story.)

I cannot give you a full list of these completely unimportant things, because it is really huge. Every employer has its own. But the most phony, the most terrible item in this list is, of course, the corporate events!

### Corporate Events Are The Main Profitability Killer

You and your colleagues are not the big family. You are [not even friends](http://theweek.com/articles/748743/coworkers-are-not-friends). And you will never be. Your employer just lies to you in order to make you less likely to leave the company. Indeed, how dare you even think about betraying your family?

Corporate events are mandatory.

Corporate events are expensive.

It does not matter if you are completely ignoring the events or you are visiting all of them. Even though in some organizations they are declared mandatory (usually offstage). Even though you may believe that by visiting them you are becoming "a better employee". Enough! You'll be fired anyway once you will stop being profitable.

Based on my small research, most of the people do not like corporate events.

Dear Employer,

You pay me for 40 hours a week. I work for you these 40 hours. I don't waste a second on watching YouTube (or PornHub), scrolling Facebook and discussing politics with my colleagues. I work like hell. Even when I'm drinking coffee, I keep thinking on how to make the code I've just written more maintainable.

Now, why do you think I should spend even _a second_ of my personal time on things that are part of my work? Yes, I am speaking about the corporate events you want me to participate in. Even if they help me communicate more efficiently with my team, still, I'd prefer to solve my working problems _at work_. You are not paying me for doing this in my free time.

You want me to join the events? No problem, if they are during working hours.

Ah, they are in the evening or on the weekend? Okay, but where is my overtime bonus then?

They are just mandatory and you don't want to pay? Well, sorry, I don't think we can continue working together.

By the way, I do meet my colleagues in my free time. I even date with some of them from time to time. But the difference is that in this case I decide _when_ to meet, _whom_ to join and _what_ to do. I am not 10 years old. Let _me_ decide.

The article is not about you because you really like the corporate events? Please, leave a comment, I would like to know the reason why you _sincerely_ like them.
