Fact 1: you are a money-making tool of your employer

Fact 3: you employer lies to you

Fact 2: you and your employer are in a conflict

Fact 4: corporate events are mandatory (remember the hint of Agris?)

Fact 5: most of the people do not like corporate events

Team building is procuration.

They are not your friends (link to the book here). How many of them will go to your funeral? Nobody will even remember about you the next day.

Dear Employer,

You pay me for 40 hours a week. I work for you these 40 hours. I don't waste a second on watching YouTube (or PornHub), scrolling Facebook and drinking coffee. I work like hell. Even when I go to a toilet, I keep thinking on how to make the code I've just written more maintainable. Now, why do you think I should spend even _a second_ of my personal time on things that are part of my work? And team events are one of these things. They help you make more money by improving team communication. They, probably, even help me to communicate with my team better. Still, dear Employer, I prefer to solve my working problems _at work_. Nobody pays me for solving them in my free time.

You want me to join the events? No problem, if they are during working hours. Ah, they are in the evening or on the weekend? Okay, but where is my overtime bonus then? They are just mandatory and you don't want to pay? Well, sorry, I don't think we can work together.

By the way, I do meet my colleagues in my free time. But the difference is that in this case I decide _when_ to meet, _whom_ to join and _what_ to do.

But What If I Will Get Fired For Ignoring These Events?

You will get fired if you will be not efficient worker. You can visit all the possible team events, but it won't help you if you are not making enough money for your employer. Indians were fired.

Don't try to make friends at work.
